Legend for file names
---------------------

This directory contains tests for the processing of arithmetic expressions.
Arithmetic expressions occur in range constraints within Teckyl's range
inference procedure.

Each file in this directory that has an 'exp' suffix contains one arithmetic
expression that serves as input for several tests. The tests are specified as
comments (starting with a '#' character) in the first few lines of each 'exp'
file. Each line of comment defines the desired output for one test; and the
correctness of test output is supposed to be verified with the 'FileCheck'
tool.

The 'exp' suffix of file names is meant to stand for "expression". The main
part of each 'exp' file's name describes the expression that the file contains,
according to the following legend.

C ~ constant
P ~ parameter
V ~ variable

_ ~ parenthesis (both opening and closing)
p ~ plus
m ~ minus
t ~ times
n ~ negate
